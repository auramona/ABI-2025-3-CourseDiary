/*
A tiny placeholder story for testing files.

Once, in a quiet city built on old railway lines, a student kept two windows open:
one for code, one for the terminal—because it made the world feel orderly.

They named the folder "data" not because it held data yet,
but because it promised that one day it would.

When the day finally arrived, the first file was not a pipeline,
but a reminder: start small, make it run, then make it right.
